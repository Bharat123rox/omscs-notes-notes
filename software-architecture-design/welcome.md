# Welcome

## Howdy Friends

Here are my notes for Software Architecture & Design, which I am taking in Summer 2021.

Each document in "Lecture Notes" corresponds to a module in Canvas. Within each document, the headings correspond to the videos within that module. Usually, I omit any introductory, summary, or administrative content.
